# EDA Project
This project uses dataset from electronics packaging research. I have been taking data for high temperature operating life analysis where I do reliability testing of 3D printed circuits which operating at high temperature.
We have devided the work into two notebook. One just has raw dataset visualisation where we tried see the raw dataset trend i.e. how the resistor or gain varies over time. Though we did some cleaning for this as well.
In second dataset, we have developed experimental model and tried to visualise the data in a deeper sense. Basically, electronics research follows IPC standards and based on these standards we tried to develop acceleration factor model which can predict failure.
The second notebook where we did the model is named Experimental_model_visualisation. In summary, the two dataset to be considered for the projects are Raw_data_visualisation.ipynb and 
Experimental_model_visualisation.ipynb. Other notebooks were our initial commits.
The dataset is a representation of the real dataset as due to non-disclosure agreement, I can not disclose the real dataset. However, I tried to replicate the real dataset and do the data analysis.
